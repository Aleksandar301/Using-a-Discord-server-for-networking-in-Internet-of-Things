# Using a Discord Server for Networking in IoT

![System Overview](assets/system_overview.PNG)


This project demonstrates how a **Discord bot can be used to interact with IoT devices**, specifically an **ESP8266** microcontroller with ultrasonic and PIR sensors. The bot can read sensor data, send alerts, plot measurements, and control devices like an LED, all through Discord commands.
